The calculator is now a class (ScientificCalculator) which encapsulates all the functionality, 
including arithmetic and scientific operations, as well as error handling and user input validation.
The ~ScientificCalculator() destructor is defined to clean up resources, 
though in this simple case, it just prints a message. You can add more resource management if needed.
